        <p><i>Hello from Upwards Learning,</i></p>

<p><i>We met your headteacher recently at an online recruitment event for your region, so we have a good picture of how induction is working and what aspects need more focus.

We run a very supportive induction process, helping both your mentor and your NQT to get the most from the free training and helping them to manage their time and cope with the pressures of the first year in a school.

We hope to hear back from you and would very much like to tell you more about our programme.</i></p>

<p><i>Best wishes<br>
Upwards Learning
