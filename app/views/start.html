        Register your school for the Early Career Framework induction programme
      </h1>

      <p>The Early Career Framework induction programme is the new statutory requirement for the induction of early career teachers that applies from September 2021 to all maintained schools in England.</p>

      <p>There is no cost to schools for this training, it is funded by the Department for Education.</p>

      <p>If you already have an induction training provider that works with your school, you may need to contact them to get information about your options for meeting the new statutory requirements. If you already know which provider you will work with in 2021 to 2022 you will be able to confirm that on this service and set up your programme.</p>
